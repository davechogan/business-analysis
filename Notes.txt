Notes

I want to add more agents
Look at running them in parallel and returning the data to the tab, as it completes and not force the order. Or have a tab order that as they complete the new tab is put in the correct place.
Interactivity - Ask questions about the results?
Add download capability
Add poweerpoint integration.
Try and use an ai system like Gamma to make the slides look really good.
Options for which analysis to run. Add more visualization capabilities. Part of the formatter or a separate step all together.
